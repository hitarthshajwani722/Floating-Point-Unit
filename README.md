# Floating-Point-Unit
This repository contains Verilog files implementing an IEEE 754 Single Precision Floating Point Unit(FPU) capable of performing addition and multiplication of signed/unsigned inputs, customizable based on your chosen operation. It also includes the HDL testbench for testing the functionality of the FPU.
